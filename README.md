## Overview

The PwC Power BI Job Simulation, completed through the Forage platform, provided a hands-on opportunity to develop and demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills. The simulation involved analyzing call center data, customer retention metrics, and diversity and inclusion statistics for a telecom client, using Power BI to generate actionable insights.

## Dataset

The project utilized the following datasets:
- Call Center Dataset: Containing metrics on customer satisfaction, call volume, and agent performance.
- Customer Retention Dataset: Including demographic data, contract types, service subscriptions, and churn status.
- Diversity & Inclusion Dataset: Featuring gender balance, promotion rates, and employee turnover statistics.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project included:
- Developing a Power BI dashboard to visualize call center performance metrics.
- Identifying trends and factors contributing to customer churn in the telecom industry.
- Analyzing HR data to provide insights on gender diversity and inclusion within the organization.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis was conducted in three main tasks:
- Call Center Analysis: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs such as customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, call volume trends, and agent performance.
- Customer Retention Analysis: Built a dashboard to identify key drivers of customer churn and proposed proactive strategies to improve retention.
- Diversity & Inclusion Analysis: Analyzed gender-related KPIs and provided recommendations to address gender balance challenges at the executive level.
