## Overview

The PwC Power BI Job Simulation, completed through the Forage platform, provided a hands-on opportunity to develop and demonstrate data analysis and visualization skills. The simulation involved analyzing call center data, customer retention metrics, and diversity and inclusion statistics for a telecom client, using Power BI to generate actionable insights.

## Dataset

The project utilized the following datasets:
- Call Center Dataset: Containing metrics on customer satisfaction, call volume, and agent performance.
- Customer Retention Dataset: Including demographic data, contract types, service subscriptions, and churn status.
- Diversity & Inclusion Dataset: Featuring gender balance, promotion rates, and employee turnover statistics.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project included:
- Developing a Power BI dashboard to visualize call center performance metrics.
- Identifying trends and factors contributing to customer churn in the telecom industry.
- Analyzing HR data to provide insights on gender diversity and inclusion within the organization.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis was conducted in three main tasks:
- Call Center Analysis: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize KPIs such as customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, call volume trends, and agent performance.
- Customer Retention Analysis: Built a dashboard to identify key drivers of customer churn and proposed proactive strategies to improve retention.
- Diversity & Inclusion Analysis: Analyzed gender-related KPIs and provided recommendations to address gender balance challenges at the executive level.

## Key findings

Call Center Performance:
- Average speed to answer: 67.52s, average talk duration: 3m 45s, with 81.08% of calls answered.
- Most agents meet performance benchmarks, with average answer speed around 66-70s and call resolution at ~72-73%.
- Satisfaction rating is moderate at 3.4/5, and only 27.08% of calls are unresolved.

Customer Return & Risk Analysis:
- High churn rate of 26.54%, with month-to-month contracts showing the highest churn (42.7%).
- Electronic check payment method has the highest churn rate among all methods.
- Fiber optic service also shows a high churn rate of 41.9%.

Diversity & Inclusion:
- Female employees perform slightly better (2.42 vs. 2.41 for males).
- Lower promotion rates for women at higher job levels.
- Women are promoted faster than men in most roles, except at the executive and director levels.
- Turnover rate is 10%, with male-dominated exits in strategy and HR.

## How to run code
1. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset by loading the files from the repository
2.  Loading the dashboard (pbix file) in Power BI
- Open Power BI Desktop and go to File > Open to load the existing dashboard from the repository.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI: Created interactive dashboards with charts, graphs, and slicers to visualize KPIs for call center performance, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Calculated key metrics like customer satisfaction, call handling performance, and churn prediction.
